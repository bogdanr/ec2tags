ec2tags
=======

Copy tags from EC2 instances and add them to associated resources such as volumes

This code is just an early tryout and it's hardcoded with tags that start with the "Product" string but feel free to improve it.

In order to use it profiles have to be defined in the aws cli tools config file and then added in the PROFILES variable.
